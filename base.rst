    I really don't know what to write here. 

    However, since I'm a Ph.D. candidate with knowledge in Deep Learning, I think it's okay to use a little help from our `friends <https://chat.openai.com/>`_.


As a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, my research explores various fields, :abbr:`including navigating the challenges of learning with noisy data, analyzing satellite and remote-sensing data, and delving into the realm of self-supervised learning (it was obvious it was ChatGPT anyway)`. A significant focus of my work involves devising novel strategies to address catastrophic forgetting in computer vision and classification tasks. 

Besides using LLMs to generate text, I'm also a tinkerer with a passion for software development. I'm proficient in **Python** (*PyTorch*, *matplotlib*, *pandas*, *scikit-learn*), Full Stack Development with **TypeScript/JavaScript** (*Node.js*, *React*, *Angular*, *Vue.js*), and the usual suspects (*LaTex*, *Git*, *Docker*). I'm also familiar with :abbr:`C++ (and Slurm, but we don't speak of it)` but I wouldn't count on me for that.
