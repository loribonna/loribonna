The article explores predicting the circulation of the West Nile virus using Deep Learning and satellite images. In particular, the spread of the virus is modeled through a graph neural network that considers the spatial and environmental relations between different locations. The proposed **MultiAdjacency Graph ATtention network** (**MAGAT**) outperforms other methods, especially when pretraining is used. The results show that the proposed model can be used to predict the spread of the virus with high accuracy.
