The research investigates integrating *Continual Learning* techniques into few-shot learning systems, training models with minimal examples from new classes. Traditional methods struggle with evolving data distributions. This study focuses on few-shot systems with dynamic data streams, using continual architectures alongside pseudolabelling and generative modeling.
